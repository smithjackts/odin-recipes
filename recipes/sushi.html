    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
        Sushi is a traditional Japanese dish that has become popular worldwide for its exquisite taste and artful presentation.<br>
        It typically consists of vinegared rice (known as sushi rice) combined with various ingredients like raw fish, seafood, vegetables, and sometimes tropical fruits. </p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Sushi Rice</li>
            <li>Fish and Seafood</li>
            <li>Nori</li>
            <li>Vegetables</li>
            <li>Tropical Fruits</li>
            <li>Wasabi</li>
            <li>Soy Sauce</li>
            <li>Pickled Ginger</li>
            <li>Sesame Seeds</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Cook the Rice: Rinse the sushi rice in cold water until the water runs clear. Cook the rice in a rice cooker or on the stovetop according to the package instructions. Once cooked, transfer the rice to a wooden or non-metallic bowl and season it with a mixture of rice vinegar, sugar, and salt. Gently fold the vinegar mixture into the rice using a cutting motion while fanning the rice to cool it down and remove excess moisture. The goal is to have shiny, slightly sticky, and seasoned sushi rice.</li>
            <li>Prepare the Ingredients: Slice the fish, seafood, and vegetables into thin, uniform pieces. If you're using nori sheets, cut them in half crosswise.</li>
            <li>Lay Out the Sushi Rolling Mat: If you're making maki sushi, lay a bamboo sushi rolling mat on a clean surface. Cover the mat with plastic wrap to prevent the rice from sticking.</li>
            <li>Prepare a Bowl of Water: Keep a small bowl of water nearby to wet your hands while handling the sushi rice. This prevents the rice from sticking to your fingers.</li>
            <li>Place Nori on the Mat (for Maki Sushi): If you're making maki rolls, place a half-sheet of nori shiny side down on the bamboo mat.</li>
            <li>Spread Sushi Rice: Moisten your hands with water and grab a handful of sushi rice. Spread the rice evenly over the nori sheet, leaving about half an inch of nori at the top edge. The layer of rice should be thin and even.</li>
            <li>Add Ingredients: Place the sliced fish, seafood, vegetables, or fruits horizontally in the center of the rice. Be mindful not to overfill the roll, as this can make rolling more challenging.</li>
            <li>Roll the Sushi: Lift the bamboo mat's edge closest to you and start rolling the sushi away from you, using the mat to help shape the roll. Apply gentle pressure to keep the roll tight. Moisten the nori edge with water to seal the roll.</li>
            <li>Cut the Roll (for Maki Sushi): With a sharp, wet knife, cut the rolled sushi into bite-sized pieces. Clean the knife between cuts to ensure clean edges.</li>
            <li>Present and Serve: Arrange the sushi pieces on a plate and serve with pickled ginger, wasabi, and soy sauce on the side. For nigiri sushi, shape small mounds of sushi rice with your hands, top with a slice of fish or seafood, and optionally add a touch of wasabi between the rice and topping.</li>
