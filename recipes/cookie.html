        <li>Granulated sugar</li>
        <li>Butter or margarine</li>
        <li>Eggs</li>

        <li>Chocolate chips</li>

    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        
        <li>Preheat the oven: Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or use a non-stick baking mat.</li>
        <li>Cream the butter and sugars: In a large mixing bowl, cream together the softened butter, granulated sugar, and brown sugar until the mixture becomes smooth and fluffy.</li>
        <li>Add eggs and vanilla: Beat in the eggs one at a time, ensuring each egg is fully incorporated before adding the next one. Mix in the vanilla extract.</li>
        <li>Combine dry ingredients: In a separate bowl, whisk together the all-purpose flour, baking soda, baking powder, and salt.</li>
        <li>Incorporate dry ingredients: Gradually add the dry ingredient mixture to the wet ingredients, mixing well until a smooth dough forms.</li>
        <li>Add chocolate chips (or any other add-ins): Stir in the chocolate chips (or your chosen add-ins) until they are evenly distributed throughout the dough.</li>
        <li>Form the cookies: Using a spoon or cookie scoop, portion out the dough onto the prepared baking sheet. Leave enough space between each cookie to allow for spreading during baking.</li>
        <li>Bake the cookies: Place the baking sheet in the preheated oven and bake for approximately 10-12 minutes, or until the edges of the cookies turn golden brown. The center may still appear slightly soft but will firm up as they cool.</li>
        <li>Cool and enjoy: Remove the cookies from the oven and let them cool on the baking sheet for a few minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely. Once cooled, enjoy your freshly baked cookies!</li>
